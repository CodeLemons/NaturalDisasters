A data visualization website developed using javascript, php, html and css together with an open source javascript charting project

Charts JS is an open source project available on GitHub, which allows users to implement all different types of charts into their website.
For my Visualization I chose to implement line charts, because I felt they represent my data better than any other graphs.

The website I worked on is using data about Natural Disasters, sthe data was pulled from the database of natural disasters, I segmented each type of disaster in its own chart displayed at the click of a button.
